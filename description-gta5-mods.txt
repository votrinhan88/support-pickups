<b>Support for InfamousSabre's Pickups GTA V Mod - v1.70.2</b> <a href="https://github.com/votrinhan88/support-pickups">GitHub</a>

<b>Features</b>
Remember InfamousSabre's <b><a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pickups">Pickups</a></b> mod? Unfortunately his mod does not support the latest DLC weapons so I tried continuing his work.
+ <b>Updating 26 DLC weapons</b> and their bullet speeds up to <b>GTA V 1.70</b>.
+ <b>Customized number of slots:</b> 8 slots and 4 slots
+ <b>Simplified installation and uninstallation.</b>

<b>Installation</b>
1. <b>REQUIRED: <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pickups">Pickups 2.2</a></b> by InfamousSabre. I only update the new weapons, which WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT HIS MOD (AND BREAK YOUR GAME).
2. Backup your two files: `GTA V/mods/update/update.rpf/common/data/ai/weapons.meta` and `GTA V/mods/update/update.rpf/common/data/pickups.meta`
3. Download Pickups 2.2 by InfamousSabre. <b>DO NOT INSTALL THROUGH OPENIV BUT EXTRACT AS ARCHIVE.</b>
4. Move the folder `Pickups` and the files `Pickups.asi`, `Pickups.ini` to GTA V folder
5. <b>DO NOT INSTALL ANYTHING ELSE FROM PICKUPS.</b> Now we move on to my update.
6. Extract my <b>Support for InfamousSabre's Pickups</b> mod
7. Move the folder `./composed/mod/Pickups` to `GTA V/Pickups`
8. Move everything inside `./weapon-merger/composed/merged/update/update.rpf/dlc_patch` to `GTA V/mods/update/update.rpf/dlc_patch`
9. Move everything inside `./composed/mod/update/update.rpf` to `GTA V/mods/update/update.rpf`
10. Optional 4 slots: move the files `pickups.xml` and `slots.xml` from `./composed/optional-4-slots` to `GTA V/Pickups`.

<b>Uninstallation</b>
1. Delete `Pickups/`, `Pickups.asi`, `Pickups.ini`
2. Extract `./weapon-merger/weapons-pickups-meta-uninstall-1.70.7z` to current folder (same level as this file).
3. Open the `./weapon-merger/composed/uninstall-content-dlcpatch.yaml` - This is the instruction to handle `content.xml` in each `dlc_patch`
4. Copy everything in `./uninstall/update/update.rpf` to  `GTA V/mods/update/update.rpf`
____+ These should have reverted the DLCs under `to-patch` in `./composed/uninstall-content-dlcpatch.yaml`
5. For the remaining DLCs, i.e. under `to-delete` in `./weapon-merger/composed/uninstall-content-dlcpatch.yaml`, you can safely delete the `content.xml` file manually.
____+ Originally these files do not exist in the vanilla version


<b>Changelog</b>
+ 1.70.2 (GTA V v1.69 Bottom Dollar Bounties - 1.70 Agents of Sabotage)
____+ Add 2 new DLC weapons
____+ Add Python script to merge all weapon-.meta and pickups.meta
____+ Add supplementary resources and documents.
