<b>Support for InfamousSabre's Pickups GTA V Mod - v1.70.beta.</b> <a href="https://github.com/votrinhan88/support-pickups">GitHub</a>

<b>Features</b>
Remember InfamousSabre's <b><a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pickups">Pickups</a></b> mod? Unfortunately his mod does not support the latest DLC weapons so I tried continuing his work.
+ <b>Updating 26 DLC weapons</b> and their bullet speeds up to <b>GTA V 1.70</b>.
+ <b>Customized number of slots:</b> 8 slots and 4 slots
+ <b>Python script to merge all weapon-.meta to one file and all pickups.meta to one file</b> --> Simplify updating, customizing and install/uninstall-ing.
+ <b>Supplementary resources</b> for custom scripting

<b>Installation</b>
+ <b>REQUIRED: <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/pickups">Pickups 2.2</a></b> by InfamousSabre. I only update the new weapons, which WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT HIS MOD (AND BREAK YOUR GAME).
